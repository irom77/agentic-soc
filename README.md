**Agentic SOC Platform** is an open-source security operations platform built on Agentic AI, enabling agents to proactively participate in triage, investigation, enrichment, and knowledge accumulation so security teams can move from alert fatigue to AI-assisted decision-making.

### Local Development

Run these commands from the repository root:

```bash
./start.sh    # Start ASP and its development services
./stop.sh     # Stop ASP while preserving database volumes
./restart.sh  # Restart ASP and its development services
./test.sh     # Run the backend Django test suite
```

Pass a Django test label to run a specific test module, class, or method:

```bash
./test.sh apps.enrichments.tests
```

### Alert Floods, Converged into Actionable Cases

Modules stream SIEM / Webhook alerts, extract IOCs, correlate related signals, and generate Cases, Alerts, and Artifacts so massive log volumes converge into a small number of actionable cases.

### AI-Powered Investigation, Seconds Not Hours

Compress hours of manual analysis into seconds, automatically producing severity, confidence, impact, priority, verdicts, and structured investigation reports.

### One Click to Drive Complex Investigations

Launch LLM investigation, knowledge extraction, threat intelligence enrichment, and CMDB enrichment around each Case, orchestrating traditional SOAR workflows and AI analysis in the same Playbook system.

### Deep Harness Agent Integration

Expose ASP capabilities to Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode and other Harness Agents through the CLI and plugins, enabling agents to operate Cases, search logs, query threat intelligence, and write modules and playbooks directly.

### Multi-SIEM Access, One Investigation Entry Point

Support Splunk, ELK configuration, unified log search, and Webhook alert ingestion so LLMs, agents, and analysts all work with the same security context.

### Automated Threat Intelligence Enrichment

Automatically enrich IOCs and Artifacts with reputation, pulses, asset, identity, and historical context so every suspicious entity appears with evidence for judgment.

### Knowledge Accumulation, Smarter Over Time

Extract reusable knowledge from closed Case investigation records, response processes, and discussions, allowing organizational experience to grow with every response.

### Collaboration, Audit, and Access Control Built In

Local / LDAP login, user roles, API Keys, Inbox notifications, and Audit Log provide foundational governance so security operations no longer depend on fragmented tools.

### Low-Cost Adaptation, Highly Flexible Customization

Use Python Modules to adapt new SIEM rules and alert sources, and use Playbooks to orchestrate LLM analysis and automated actions so the platform grows with your security scenarios.

### Open Source, Private Deployment, Python & Typescript

MIT licensed, fully local deployment supported. Security data stays inside your network, while the backend, frontend, and extension scripts remain clear and controllable.

## Maintaining the Cyber Edition

This product variant is maintained on the long-lived `cyber-edition` branch and is
not intended to be merged back into `master`. The `master` branch remains a clean
reference to the upstream project.

Before refreshing `master`, commit or stash any work in progress. Then fetch the
upstream repository and fast-forward the local reference branch:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git switch master
git merge --ff-only upstream/master
```

To review upstream changes without modifying `cyber-edition`:

```bash
git log --oneline cyber-edition..master
git diff cyber-edition...master
```

To adopt a complete upstream commit, copy its hash from the log and cherry-pick
it onto the fork:

```bash
git switch cyber-edition
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

To adopt only selected files from upstream instead of a complete commit:

```bash
git switch cyber-edition
git restore --source master -- path/to/file
git diff
git add path/to/file
git commit -m "chore: adopt selected upstream change"
```

Resolve and test any conflicts in the context of `cyber-edition`; upstream commits
may depend on earlier changes that also need to be selected.
